# Console Text To Speech
This program is meant to be an intuitive text-to-speech program that runs on the command line.
This was made with streamers who struggle speaking in mindâ€”but is open to use for many other things.
This uses SSML and includes markdown-esque formatting for the effects.

## Quickstart

- **Install Java 17+** if you havenâ€™t already.
  - **Recommended (OpenJDK):** [Adoptium Temurin 17](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=17)
  - **Oracle JDK 17 (Login Required):** [Oracle JDK 17 Archive](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
  - **Linux/macOS users:** [Install via SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)
  - Confirm installation with `java -version`
- **Download or compile the program**, then run it.
- When first launched, it will generate default config files.
- Open the generated config files and fill in:
  - Your [AWS IAM](#aws) credentials in `tokens.yml`
- If you intend to use the Twitch integration:
  - Twitch Client ID and Secret in `tokens.yml`
  - Your Twitch username in `twitch-api.username`
  - Follow the instructions in [The Twitch Integration](#twitch-integration) section to set up a Twitch application
- Reload or restart the app and start typing â€” messages will be read aloud!


### AWS
Using this requires an AWS account: https://aws.amazon.com/

You can use a free account - please check the [limits and pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/).

1. Go to **IAM / Users / Security Credentials**
2. Create or use an existing user
3. Generate an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
4. Enter them into `tokens.yml`:
```yml
aws:
access-key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

More info: [Setting up IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/iam-setup.html)

## Voice Prefixes
The `voice-prefixes` section allows you to define short keywords that change the voice for any message that begins with them.
They are matched case-insensitively and tolerate `:` or `-` afterward.

Example:
```yml
voice-prefixes:
Sal: Salli
Kim: Kimberly
Bri: Brian
```

---

## Default Effects
You can set default prosody effects to apply to speech that doesn't have other effects. 

```yml
default-effects:
type: prosody
volume: medium
pitch: default
rate: medium
```

---

## Speech Effect Markdown
This is where the effects are declared. [SSML Tags Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)

These must wrap around the text like `**text**` or `~~text~~` similar to how most markdown works.

Effect declaration format:
```yml
speech-effect-markdown:
"**":
    type: prosody
    volume: x-loud
    pitch: low
    rate: slow
"~~":
    type: amazon:effect
    name: whispered
"__":
    type: emphasis
    level: strong
"*":
    type: prosody
    volume: x-loud
    rate: x-fast
    pitch: x-high
"||":
    type: say-as
    interpret-as: expletive
```

> Note
> 
> Self-closing tags (e.g., `<break/>`) are not supported yet.

---

## Text Replacements
Run as regex-safe replacements so they don't catch partial words.
```yml
text-replacements:
"<3": "heart emoji"
```

---

## Other Settings
```yml
internal-settings:
server-port: 3000            # Port for local Amazon Polly API server
twitch-auth-port: 8080       # Must match Twitch App's redirect URI port
```

---

## Twitch Integration

### Creating a Twitch App
To use Twitch chat integration:
- Go to the [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
- Click **"Register Your Application"**
- Set the **OAuth Redirect URL** to match the value you define in `twitch-auth-port` (i.e., `http://localhost:8080` if the port is 8080).
- Select `Chat Bot` or something similar
- **GO TO THE BOTTOM AND CLICK SAVE - after doing the captcha, idk I managed to miss this and kept not saving the port properly** 
- After creating the app, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Place these values into your `tokens.yml`:
  ```yml
twitch:
  client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### Twitch Configuration

```yml
twitch-api:
  enable: false             # Whether the integration should be enabled or not
  messages:
    send: false             # Whether messages *you* type should be sent to twitch chat or not
    clean-markdown: true    # If the above is true - whether the messages should be stripped of markdown or not
  channel: ""               # Channel to connect to
  username: ""              # Username to use - NOTE this MUST be the user you authenticated with - or it won't work lol
  
  # This section allows you to set how certain groups' chat will look in the console. You can use any UTF-8 characters,
  # as long as your console supports it. It probably also works with UTF-16 but I haven't checked.   
  # The permissions are the CommandPermissions linked below
  chat:   
    default:
      format: "%user% âžœ %message%"
      weight: 0
      permission: EVERYONE
    mod:
      format: "<br-green>âš” %user%</color> âžœ %message%"
      weight: 10
      permission: MODERATOR

```
